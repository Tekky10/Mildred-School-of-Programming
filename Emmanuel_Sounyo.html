		<h1>My Biography </h1>

		<p>I started my tech career after graduation by first obtaining a certification course in CCNA in 2016 from NIIT before my National Youth Service Corps in Nigeria.</p>
		
		<p>I self taught my way into web development using the application called Sololearn it is a nice application as it enables users who don't have a laptop or desktop to practice coding via mobile devices.</br>
		It also comes with a user friendly environment where pariticipants on the application challange each other for points and gain ranking globally. I obtained various certifications via sololearn ranging from HTML to CSS to JavaScript to Jquery which enabled me bag gigs in web development.</br>
		I also moved on to getting certification in <strong>Amazon Cloud Computing Practitioner</strong> </br>
